node-red-contrib-feedparser-3
========================

A modified version of [node-red-node-feedparser](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-nodes/tree/master/social/feedparser) 

Added an input for injection, this is good for debugging the flow or a flexible interval.

Added an option to parse an expression, e.g. to read a feed from a msg argument.

Install
-------

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`

        npm install node-red-contrib-feedparser-3
